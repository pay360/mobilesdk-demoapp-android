#PayPoint Advanced Payments SDK Demo

Demonstrates how to integrate the [PayPoint Advanced Payments SDK](https://github.com/paypoint/mobilesdk-android) into your app.

##Quickstart

Register for an account at [PayPoint Explorer](https://developer.paypoint.com/payments/explore/#/register)

Replace the installation id in PaymentActivity with the installation id in the email response (either Hosted Cashier or Cashier API)

```java
private static final String INSTALLATION_ID = <YOUR_INSTALLATION_ID>;
```

That's it! You should now be able to run up the demo app and make test payments.

Test card numbers can be found [here](https://developer.paypoint.com/payments/docs/#getting_started/test_cards)

To view your transactions, log into the [Portal](https://portal.mite.paypoint.net:3443/portal-client/#/en_gb/log_in)

See [SDK repository](https://github.com/paypoint/mobilesdk-android) for more detailed usage instructions.
