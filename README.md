#PayPoint Advanced Payments SDK

Requires at minimum Android 4.0 (API level 14)

**NOTE this step will change once the library is available as a Maven artifact**

Copy the PayPoint SDK library paypoint_sdk-x.x.x.aar into the module libs folder.

Add the following to your module dependencies

```groovy

// TODO use correct Maven Repo when known
    compile('net.paypoint:mobilesdk-android:x.y.z')
}
```

In the module gradle build set minSdkVersion to 14 or above.

Add the following to your AndroidManifest.xml

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />

<activity android:name="com.paypoint.sdk.library.ThreeDSActivity"
    android:screenOrientation="portrait">
</activity>
```

##Making a Payment

Create a simple activity accepting a card number, expiry and CV2.
Get an instance of PaymentManager in onCreate()

```java
paymentManager = PaymentManager.getInstance(this)
        .setUrl(URL_PAYPOINT);
```

Use EndpointManager.getEndpointUrl() to get the URL for a PayPoint environment.

Register a payment callback handler in OnResume and unregister the callback in OnPause to ensure your activity handles device orientation changes correctly if not locked to a single orientation.

```java
@Override
protected void onPause() {
    super.onPause();

    paymentManager.lockCallback();
    paymentManager.unregisterPaymentCallback();
}

@Override
protected void onResume() {
    super.onResume();

    paymentManager.registerPaymentCallback(this);
    paymentManager.unlockCallback();
}
```

In your payment button handler build a PaymentRequest

```java
PaymentCard card = new PaymentCard()
        .setPan("2470456729287342")
        .setExpiryDate("0116")
        .setCv2("457")
        .setCardHolderName("Mr A Smith");

Transaction transaction = new Transaction()
        .setCurrency(“GBP”)
        .setAmount("10.54")
        .setMerchantReference(merchantRef); // up to merchant to create a unique merchantRef

// create the payment request
PaymentRequest request = new PaymentRequest()
        .setCard(card)
        .setTransaction(transaction);
```

To submit an authorisation instead of a payment call setDeferred(true) on the transaction.

The cardholder address, financial services data and customer details can also optionally be created and set on the request.

Your activity will need to implement the PaymentManager.MakePaymentCallback interface.

Validate the payment details handling the PaymentValidationException

```java
paymentManager.validatePaymentDetails(request);
```

Note: the PaymentManager also provides static functions for inline validation of the card fields as they are being entered

```java
public static void validatePan(String pan) throws PaymentValidationException

public static void validateExpiry(String expiryDate) throws PaymentValidationException

public static void validateCv2(String cv2) throws PaymentValidationException
```

PaymentValidationException holds an error code enumeration describing the error.

If the PaymentRequest validates successfully i.e. does not throw a PaymentValidationException, your app should then communicate with your server to request a PayPoint authorisation token. This token, when returned, should be used to create a PayPointCredentials object which should then be passed to the PaymentManager

```java
PayPointCredentials credentials = new PayPointCredentials()
        .setInstallationId((<YOUR_INSTALLATION_ID>);)
        .setToken(token);

paymentManager.setCredentials(credentials);
```

Next, make the payment by calling makePayment() on the PaymentManager passing the request storing the returned operation identifier should you wish to retrieve the status of the transaction at a later point, see Error Handling.

```java
operationId = paymentManager.makePayment(request);
```

This call to makePayment() will callback to your app when completed in one of the following functions

```java
public void paymentSucceeded(PaymentSuccess paymentSuccess)

public void paymentFailed(PaymentError paymentError)
```

PaymentSuccess - has accessors for transaction id, merchant reference, amount, currency and last four digits of the card number.
PaymentError – use getKind() to return the type of error. PayPoint errors contain a reasonCode and reasonMessage which can be used to feedback to the user

NOTE - the SDK will always callback within a set timeout period (defaulted to 60s). If you wish to change the timeout period call PaymentManager.setSessionTimeout().
Care should be taken when setting this value as short timeouts might not allow enough time for the payment to be authorized.
This timeout does not include any delays resulting from the user being redirected to 3D Secure.

##Error Handling

If a payment fails e.g. SDK calls back into paymentFailed(), there will be instances where the payment is in an indeterminate\unknown state i.e. the transaction times out or a network error occurred.
Where the state of the transaction is unknown (shouldCheckStatus() on the ReasonCode returns true) you should query the state of the last transaction by calling getTransactionStatus passing the operation identifier returned by makePayment.
Calling makePayment again at this point may result in a duplicate payment so should be avoided.

The function getTransactionStatus will use the same callback mechanism as makePayment().

##Get Status of a Previous Transaction

Use PaymentManager.getTransactionStatus to retrieve the status of a previous transaction, passing in the operation id generated by makePayment.
The function getTransactionStatus will use the same callback mechanism as makePayment().
