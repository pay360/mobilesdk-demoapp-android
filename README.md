# Pay360 Advanced Payments SDK Demo

Demonstrates how to integrate the [Pay360 Advanced Payments SDK](https://github.com/paypoint/mobilesdk-android) into your app.

## Quickstart

Sign up for an Explorer account at [Pay360 Explorer](https://developer.paypoint.com/payments/explore/#/register)

Replace the installation id in PaymentActivity with the Cashier API installation id you are provided with after sign up.

```java
private static final String INSTALLATION_ID = <YOUR_INSTALLATION_ID>;
```

That's it! You should now be able to run up the demo app and make test payments.

A set of test cards for MITE (Merchant Integration Test Environment) are available here: [MITE test cards](https://developer.paypoint.com/payments/docs/#getting_started/test_cards)

Payments made through the demo app can be tracked in our MITE [Portal](https://portal.mite.paypoint.net:3443/portal-client/#/en_gb/log_in)

See [SDK repository](https://github.com/paypoint/mobilesdk-android) for more detailed usage instructions.
